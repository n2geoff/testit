## Developing

There is only one main source file in the project. It is the [/src/index.js](/src/index.js).
The [test/index.spec.js](test/index.spec.js) is for now the only unit test file in the project.

The `dist` includes the minified version of the source code.

## Running tests

Run unit tests using this command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Reporting a bug

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/n2geoff/js-lib/issues) to report any bug you find.
Bugs description should include:

* How to reproduce the bug;
* Easy to understand title;

Would be nice to have some code showing how to reproduce the code, you may use [gist](https://gist.github.com) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io) for uploading your example code.

## Request a feature

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/n2geoff/js-lib/issues) to request a new feature.

Keep in mind, this is a pure javascript library

## Commit message

Commit messages should includes GitHub number reference and a imperative easy to understand sentence.

## Coding style

If it is supported in all major browers without transpiling, then please use those JavaScript language features in your code, with one caveat -- readablity is king. 

Currently all ES5 and ES6/ES2015 are available.

This project is linted agaist [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) and the [`.jshintrc`](.jshintrc) is dead-simple, and all you need to followed.
